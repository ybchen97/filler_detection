# Meeting with Professor Bryan

### Data synthesis

* There seems to be a need to utter meaningful sentences, does not really work for “meaningful” text
* For an MVP, not in a rush to synthesise meaningful sentences
* Both good and bad: the data distribution used for training may not align with the real-world distribution of words
    * Have two scenarios: Use the real-world distribution and also test-set distribution for testing
    * Manual segmentation of test data vs automatic segmentation
    * Same work uttered by different races

### Training model

* Tembusu has resources (Tembusu compute cluster)
* NSCC: Can use their supercomputer cluster
* Consider using cloud services: we get them for free

### Significance of the product

* Bryan unsure about why the product is needed
* He understands that filler words might not be good in speech, but it’s okay if it falls below a threshold
* Maybe can use previous research and other sources to substantiate why filler words are not good

### Experiments conducted for the product

* The experiments conducted should match the underlying motivation for the product

### Report

* Discussing the ethical implications of the product
* Consider the benefits/infringements on people’s society
* Think about what to include in report: can always refer to other websites/sources
