## General project idea
This project is about detecting the common filler words that we use in our everyday conversations such as "uhm", "err", "like" etc. Through this project, we hope to develop an application/service that tracks the usage of such filler words in our speech, and allow people to use this information to improve their speaking fluency and coherency.
